# Capstone-Project-Python
This project has 4 classes being Box, Sphere, Cylinder, and Torus. We read in from a file and parse the data to then create a dictionary of shapes. This dictionary of shapes will have a bunch of different shapes along with their respective dimensions. The dictionary is turned into a data frame and then the program displays the data frame.
